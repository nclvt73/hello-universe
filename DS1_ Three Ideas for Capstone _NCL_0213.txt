Three Data Science Project Ideas- N. Lange

1- Time Usage vs. Mood:
How do people spend their time, in terms of activity, and in terms of mood or experience? 

Variant A- Compare available metrics for time usage and mood/happiness. Evaluate relationships among these areas, with an eye toward identifying correlations, etc.

Potential data sources:

American Time Use Survey:
https://www.atusdata.org/atus-action/variables/group

US Happiness - related metrics:

World Happiness: 
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

Alternate Variant- B:
Identify categories of mood (and potentially of time usage) to produce new metrics from available social media data, eg- via text mining and cluster analysis. (This could then be used to do additional analysis along the lines of Variant A.)

Potential data source: Text mining of Twitter data:

2- Characterizing Media Presentation of Climate Change and its Relationship to Beliefs: 

How is climate change discussed in news and/or social media, and how does this relate to beliefs about climate change?  Perform text mining to identify categories of presentation in news or social media text; investigate potential relationships between these categories and available belief metrics (or among the categories themselves).

Potential data sources:

Climate Change Belief metrics- US:

World:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country

Climate Change media coverage:

Approach A1- Obtain news articles via web scraping 
Note- Likely too labor intensive for the confines of the course.

Approach A2- Identify news media data already available in a readily ingested form:

Search ongoing- potential data source/reference:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312015168_Beyond_false_balance_How_interpretive_journalism_shapes_media_coverage_of_climate_change

Approach A3- Produce a pilot data source with an eye toward establishing a basis for continuing work, and inviting others to contribute.

Approach B- Use social media as an alternative to, or potentially as a secondary source for, news media data:

Potential data source: Text mining of Twitter data:

3- Other Ways to Talk About a Tomato:

Expand on the content provided by Rotten Tomatoes & similar review aggregating sites by evaluating additional attributes or categories to be derived via text mining of reviews (eg- strength of feelings expressed by the reviewer); consider potential relationships to other attributes.

Alternate Variant- Perform text mining on movie-related social media posts or user reviews, rather than on formal reviews.
